### What We're Testing:
- UI/UX design ability
- Component organization
- Responsive design skills
- Data visualization creativity
- Attention to detail

### Requirements:

**A. Visual Redesign**
The current dashboard is basic and ugly. Make it:

- **Visually Appealing** - Good use of colors, spacing, typography
- **Intuitive** - Easy to understand at a glance
- **Brand Appropriate** - Remember: this is for a sustainable/eco-friendly company

**B. Key Metrics & Data Visualization**
Create an engaging dashboard that shows:

**Required Metrics (choose your own layout):**
- Total inventory value across all warehouses (in dollars)
- Number of products below reorder point (low stock alert count)
- Total number of products/SKUs
- Number of warehouse locations
- Any other metrics you think are valuable

**Required Visualizations (choose 2-3 to implement):**
- Inventory value by warehouse (pie chart, bar chart, or your creative take)
- Stock status distribution (how many products are critical/low/adequate/overstocked)
- Top 5-10 most valuable products by total inventory value
- Products by category breakdown
- Or propose your own visualization that adds business value

**C. Enhanced Inventory Table**
Improve the current inventory overview table:
- Better visual hierarchy
- Color coding for stock status (critical = red, low = yellow, good = green)
- Sortable columns (click header to sort)
- Search/filter functionality (by product name, category, or stock status)
- Responsive design (table should work on mobile - consider card layout)
- Show which warehouse has the most/least stock for each product

**D. Technical Requirements**
- Use a charting library: [Recharts](https://recharts.org/), [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), [Nivo](https://nivo.rocks/), or your choice

## Task 2: Implement Stock Transfer System (Backend Focus)

**Objective:** Build a complete stock transfer workflow with proper business logic, validation, and data integrity. Show us your backend and data handling skills.

### What We're Testing:
- Business logic implementation
- Data validation & integrity
- API design
- Error handling
- Understanding of database concepts

### Requirements:

**A. Data Structure**
Create a new file: `data/transfers.json` with this structure:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "productId": 2,
    "fromWarehouseId": 1,
    "toWarehouseId": 3,
    "quantity": 100,
    "reason": "Restocking regional warehouse",
    "transferDate": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
    "status": "completed",
    "createdBy": "System Admin"
  }
]
```

**B. API Endpoint**
Create `/api/transfers` that handles:

**POST /api/transfers** - Create new transfer
- Accepts: productId, fromWarehouseId, toWarehouseId, quantity, reason
- **CRITICAL VALIDATION:**
  - ‚úÖ Source warehouse must have enough stock (quantity >= requested amount)
  - ‚úÖ Source and destination warehouses cannot be the same
  - ‚úÖ Quantity must be positive integer
  - ‚úÖ Product and warehouses must exist
- **ATOMIC UPDATE:** 
  - Decrease stock at source warehouse
  - Increase stock at destination warehouse
  - Create transfer record
  - **ALL THREE must succeed, or ALL THREE must fail** (data integrity)
- Returns: Success message with transfer details OR detailed error message

**GET /api/transfers** - Retrieve transfer history
- Returns all transfers with product and warehouse names (not just IDs)
- Optional: support filtering by productId, warehouseId, or date range

**C. Transfer Page UI**
Create `/transfers` page with:

**Transfer Form:**
- Select product (dropdown showing: SKU - Product Name)
- Select source warehouse (dropdown showing: Code - Name - Location)
- Select destination warehouse (should exclude source from options)
- Quantity input (with validation)
- Reason/Notes (text area)
- Submit button (disabled while submitting)
- Display current available stock when product + source selected

**Transfer History Table:**
- Date/Time
- Product (name & SKU)
- From Warehouse ‚Üí To Warehouse (with arrow icon)
- Quantity
- Reason
- Status badge
- Sort by date (newest first)

**D. Error Handling**
Your system must gracefully handle:
- Insufficient stock (show: "Only 50 units available at Main DC")
- Invalid warehouse selection
- Network errors
- Concurrent transfer attempts (edge case: what if stock is transferred twice simultaneously?)

### What We Want to See:
- üß† **Logical thinking** - Proper validation sequence
- üîí **Data integrity** - No way to corrupt stock levels
- üêõ **Error handling** - User-friendly error messages
- üìä **Data relationships** - Joining data from multiple JSON files
- üéØ **Edge cases** - You thought about what could go wrong

### Success Criteria:
- Cannot transfer more stock than available (validation works)
- Stock levels always accurate after transfers
- Clear error messages guide the user
- Transfer history is complete and accurate
- Code handles edge cases gracefully
- API responses are well-structured

---

## Task 3: Build Low Stock Alert & Reorder System (Operations Focus)

**Objective:** Create a practical system that helps warehouse managers identify and act on low stock situations. Show us you understand real business needs.

### What We're Testing:
- Understanding of business operations
- Practical problem-solving
- User-focused design
- Calculation accuracy
- Actionable insights

### Requirements:

**A. Alert Detection Logic**
Calculate which products need attention:

**Stock Status Categories:**
- üî¥ **CRITICAL:** Total stock < 20% of reorder point
- üü° **LOW:** Total stock between 20-100% of reorder point  
- üü¢ **ADEQUATE:** Total stock between 100-300% of reorder point
- üîµ **OVERSTOCKED:** Total stock > 300% of reorder point

**Note:** Total stock = sum across ALL warehouses

**B. Alerts Page**
Create `/alerts` page showing:

**Alert Cards/Table with:**
- Product name & SKU
- Current total stock (across all warehouses)
- Reorder point threshold
- Stock deficit (how many units below reorder point)
- **Recommended reorder quantity:** 
  ```
  Formula: (Reorder Point √ó 2) - Current Stock
  Minimum: Reorder Point
  ```
- Status badge (Critical/Low/Adequate/Overstocked)
- Breakdown by warehouse (expandable section showing stock at each location)

**Filtering & Sorting:**
- Filter by status (Critical, Low, All)
- Filter by category
- Sort by: severity, product name, deficit amount

**Action Buttons:**
- "Mark as Ordered" (changes status, adds timestamp)
- "View Product Details" (links to product)
- Optional: "Generate PO" button (just shows what a PO would look like)

**C. Dashboard Integration**
Add to main dashboard (Task 1):
- Alert summary card showing count of critical/low items
- Color-coded badges (red for critical, yellow for low)
- Click to navigate to alerts page
- Visual indicator for critical alerts (optional: pulse animation, notification badge)

**D. Persistence**
Create `data/alerts.json` to track:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "productId": 5,
    "status": "active",
    "severity": "critical",
    "detectedDate": "2025-01-10",
    "orderedDate": null,
    "orderedBy": null,
    "notes": ""
  }
]
```

### What We Want to See:
- üìä **Accurate calculations** - Math is correct across warehouses
- üíº **Business understanding** - You get why this matters
- üéØ **Actionable design** - Helps users make decisions quickly
- üìà **Useful recommendations** - Reorder quantities make sense
- üöÄ **Practical UX** - A warehouse manager could actually use this

### Success Criteria:
- Correctly identifies products below reorder point
- Calculations account for stock across all warehouses
- Clear, actionable recommendations
- Easy to filter and find critical items
- Alert status can be updated (mark as ordered)
- Integrates seamlessly with dashboard
